# Image Analysis - Group 10 / ITU 
On the prediction of skin cancer by the features of lesions

## Project goals
In this project we aimed to learn to measure features in images of skin lesions, and predict the diagnosis from these features through machine learning.

Since the code needs to be updated we kept the in original coondition. For the finalized, clear files go reports/final_project_files folder. 
These files were submitted. 

## Code of the project
For the project we we used Python, and jupyter notebook.
