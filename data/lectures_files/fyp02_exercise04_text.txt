==== EXERCISE 04, FIRST YEAR PROJECT 2021, PROJECT 2

Doing this exercise is doing work for your submission. You do not have to finish all the points listed below within the exercise time of 2 hours! Use the exercise time to start (with help from TAs), and then finish everything within 2 days together with your group. The next exercise will build on that.

- Integrate your external datasets into your main dataset
- Each time you add variables, run a model showing what effect they have on your other predictor. This should answer your Task 4 research question
